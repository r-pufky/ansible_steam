# Steam Role Options.
###############################################################################
# Install steamcmd with optional base dependencies for running windows servers.
# Pre-configured servers will install all files and services required to run a
# game. Servers require additional space listed in each game.
#
# Install size: ~162MB
#     Steamcmd: ~4.3MB (base).
#   Winetricks: ~3.6MB (base).
#     Packages: ~55MB.

# Automatically add Debian APT sources if required?
#
# Additional APT components (contrib, non-free, non-free-firmware) are required
# for Steam installation.
#
# winehq sources are install if steam_srv_wine_enable=true.
#
# Alternatively these sources must be manually added outside of this role.
#
# Default: True.
steam_srv_auto_add_apt_sources_enable: true

# WINE Options
###############################################################################

# Install wine? Default: False.
steam_srv_wine_enable: false

# Wine release.
#
# Values:
#    stable: Annual release - for most games (default).
#   staging: Pre-annual release with experimental patches - typically contains
#            patches for recent releases. Use only if 'stable' does not work.
#     devel: Bi-weekly release of development head - bleeding edge. Not
#            recommended.
#
# Default: 'stable'.
steam_srv_wine_release: 'stable'

# Winetricks release.
#
# Requires steam_srv_wine_release set.
#
# Always read release notes before updating versions. Role is only developed
# for LTS releases.
#
# Versions (Date):
#        DATE: Safe - Usually requires no role updates.
#   RECOMMEND: Only increment DATE. Never use 'latest'.
#
# Values:
#   {VERSION}: Tagged release to use ('20250102').
#      latest: Use latest stable release.
#
# Default: '20250102'.
#
# Reference:
# * https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks/releases
steam_srv_winetricks_release: '20250102'

# Enable wine raw network access?
#
# Allows applications that need to send and receive raw IP packets to do so in
# wine. Disabled by default because it carries a potential security risk. Only
# enable if wine application requires it.
#
# Default: False.

###############################################################################
# Steam User
###############################################################################

#
# Enable steam_srv_create_user if this group is not externally managed.

steam_srv_backup_root: '/srv/backup'

# Enable user management of media files?
#
# Use steam_srv_user to execute media management commands. Role applies media
# permissions using 'root' by default. For mounted data locations (NFS with
# squashed mounts, mapped container mounts, etc) the local root user will not
# have sufficient privileges to modify these files.
#
# Applies to:
# * steam_srv_backup_root
#
# Default: False.
